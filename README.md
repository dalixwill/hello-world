GitHub introduction/demo

I was told to write something about myself so here goes. I'm a fifth year graduate student studying Materials Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. My research focuses on modeling strain localization in amorphous structures. I'm also interested in data science and managing big data. I hope to use machine learning techniques to study the nucleation and growth of shear transformation zones (STZs) into mature shear bands.
